# conference-matchmaker
This repository contains an intelligent system for optimizing networking opportunities at a conference by recommending relevant participants to one another. The goal is to maximize individual satisfaction by matching each attendee with the top 5 other participants they are most likely to benefit from meeting.

This system uses a custom metaheuristic algorithm to explore the space of possible matchings. The algorithm iteratively improves potential solutions by evaluating the global satisfaction function and applying heuristic operators inspired by nature-inspired optimization or stochastic local search
